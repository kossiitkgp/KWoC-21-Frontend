# STATS

- __How are commits counted?__

  - Commits are counted only after your PR is merged.
  - Commits are counted if they are merged in the branch opted by mentor.Mentor is given the option to select the branch and can change it any time during the event.
  - Commits that are not linked to your GitHub account will not be counted towards KWoC, this may happen if your email configuration is not set properly. See [this](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/kwoc-bugs/issues/22#issuecomment-747068412) for details.

 ###  PS - The main aim of stats was to provide encouragement but not create a competitive atmosphere.
